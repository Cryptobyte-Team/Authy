# Security Policy

## Support
Due to the nature of open source projects we do not provide customer support for individuals or businesses using this template. That being said we will do our best to maintain security updates or mark the repository as read-only when it's no longer being updated. The latest version in `main` is always the best version to use for the latest updates to security.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you notice a security vulnerability within our source you can either [contribute a fix]() or report it to us via the ["Issues" tab](https://github.com/Cryptobyte-Team/Authy/issues). Please make sure to be as detailed as possible when filing issues for security vulnerabilities so that we can fix them quickly!
