## Authy - NodeJS, TypeScript Authentication Template
Authy is a simple template for user authentication in NodeJS using modern tooling such as TypeScript while being minimal and effective. Authy is designed with the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) intentionally keeping the code, requirements, etc. simple so that we don't accidentally introduce vulnerabilities or collect and store too much information about users. Authy is also designed to be a secure default using security techniques such as modern password hashing via Argon2, deep email verification to prevent spam and common password lookup to prevent users from using common passwords that would make their account less secure.
